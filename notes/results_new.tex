\section*{Preliminaries}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let there be $N$ children indexed by $n$.
    \item Let the vector of production parameters to be estimated be $(\rho,\gamma,\phi,\phi_{\theta},\delta)$ where $(\rho,\gamma)$ are the elasticity parameters, $\phi$ represents the coefficients on observables that determine the factor shares, $\phi_{\theta}$ is the vector of coefficients that determine $\theta$ (TFP), and $\delta$ is the vector of cobb-douglas factor shares in the outer aggregator.
    \item Here we assume:
    \[ f(\cdot) = \left[\left(a_{m}\tau_{m}^\rho+a_{f}\tau_{f}^\rho+a_{g}g^\rho\right)^{\gamma / \rho}(1-a_{Y}) + a_{Y}Y_{c}^{\gamma}\right]^{1/\gamma} \]
    where
    \begin{eqnarray}
        a_{x} = \frac{\exp(\phi_{x}Z)}{1+\exp(\phi_{m}Z)+\exp(\phi_{f}Z)+\exp(\phi_{g}Z)},\ \forall x\in\{m,f,g\} \nonumber \\
        a_{Y} = \frac{\exp(\phi_{Y}Z)}{1+\exp(\phi_{Y}Z)} \nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}
    and $a_{f}=0$ for single women. This normalization of factor shares differs slightly from the text, but is necessary to guarantee each aggregator has a Cobb-Douglas form as $\rho$ and $\gamma$ approach 0.
    \item We use $\tilde{\cdot}$ to indicate the \emph{perceived} value of a production parameter as it can be inferred from the demand system.
    \item As in the original paper, we exploit that:
     \[ \mathcal{J}_{n,t} = \Phi_{\mathcal{J},m}(\Pi_{n,t},Z_{n,t})\tau_{m,n,t},\ \mathcal{J}\in\{Y_{C},g,\tau_{f}\} \]
    where $\Pi_{n,t}$ is the vector of prices for child $n$ at time $t$ and $Z_{n,t}$ is the vector of observables that can plausibly shift factor shares. We suppress dependence of $\Phi$ on the parameters $\tilde{\omega}=(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{\gamma},\tilde{\phi})$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Relative Demand Moments}
As before, relative demand is summarized by the parameters $\tilde{\omega}$ which can be estimated by forming moment conditions on the difference between observed input ratios and those predicted by prices (with deviations are explained only by measurement error in inputs).

Formally, moment conditions for relative demand are given as in Equation (36) in the first draft, with the specific residuals for each year given by Table (14) in the paper. Each residual is interacted with the full set of covariates that are allowed to affect factor shares, as well as the relevant relative prices for that particular residual. {\color{red}No instruments for prices are used yet for these estimates.}

Let $g_{1,N}(\tilde{\omega})$ indicate the vector of moments from these relative demand residuals each interacted with their respective instruments. The estimates in Table \ref{res1} below report the solution to:

\[ \hat{\tilde{\omega}} = \arg\min\frac{1}{2}g_{1,N}(\tilde{\omega})^{T}\hat{\Omega}^{-1}g_{1,N}(\tilde{\omega}) \]
where $\hat{\Omega}$ is an estimate of the variance of the moment conditions from a first stage estimate using the identity weighting matrix.

Some of the specifications below rely on grouped fixed effect estimates from the mother's wage equation, assuming the model:
\[ \log(W_{mt}) = \mu_{k(m)} + X_{mt}\beta + \epsilon_{mt} \]
where $X_{mt}$ includes education dummies, age and age squared, and $k(m)\in\{1,2,...,K\}$ is mother $m$'s type. It is estimated via an iterative clustering algorithm. Specifications (2) and (3) use dummy variables indicating each mother's type from a clustering routine with $K=3$. Specifications (4) and (5) instead uses the estimated value of $\mu_{k(m)}$ for each $m$, with $K=10$, which enters parametrically.

\subsection*{Testing correlation in residuals}
Assuming that measurement error is not correlated over time, any correlation in the relative demand residuals over time can be explained by persistent unobserved heterogeneity in demand. The results below report a simple test of the null hypothesis that no such heterogeneity exists, which implies that the test statistic:
\[ T_{N} = \sqrt{N}\frac{\sum_{n}\xi_{Y,m,n,0}\xi_{Y,m,n,5}}{\sqrt{s^2_{Y,m,0}s^2_{Y,m,5}}} \]
is asymptotically standard normal under the null. Here, $\xi_{Y,m,n,t}$ is the residual in the demand for childcare relative to mother's time for child $n$ at time $t$ and $s^2_{Y,m,t}$ is the corresponding sample variance across individuals.

\section*{Joint Estimation with Relative Demand and Achievement Moments}

Next, the intratemporal moment conditions are expanded to include intertemporal moment conditions on skill outcomes. Differently from the original approach, the overall input $X_{n,t}$ may be imputed using separate relative demand parameters. For the case of single mothers (for example) this is:

\[ X_{n,t}(\Pi_{n,t}) = \left(\left(a_{m}(\phi_{m},Z_{n,t}) + a_{g,t}(\phi_{g},Z_{n,t})\Phi_{g,m}(\Pi_{n,t},Z_{n,t})^\rho\right)^{\gamma/
\rho} + \Phi_{Y,m}(\Pi_{n,t},Z_{n,t})^\gamma\right)^{1/\gamma}\tau_{m,n,t}
 \]
where the $\Phi$ functions depend on the perceived production parameters $\tilde{\omega}$ and total investment additionally depends on their true values, $\omega$. Write:
\[ X_{n,t} = \mathcal{X}(\Pi_{n,t},Z_{n,t},\tilde{\omega},\omega)\tau_{m,n,t}.\]
As in the previous draft, we must iterate the outcome equation forward and using a modeling assumption to impute investment in missing periods. Let $\overline{p}(\Pi_{n,t},Z_{n,t},\omega,\tilde{\omega})$ indicate the \emph{effective} composite price of $X$, which can be defined as dollars of expenditure per investment unit:
\[ \overline{p}(\Pi_{n,t},Z_{n,t},\omega,\tilde{\omega}) = \frac{p_{t}g_{n,t}+P_{c,t}Y_{c,n,t}+W_{m,n,t}\tau_{m,n,t}+W_{f,n,t}\tau_{f,n,t}}{X_{n,t}} \]
which due to the proportional investment rules, takes the same form as equation (9) in the first draft:
\[ \overline{p}(\Pi_{n,t},Z_{n,t},\omega,\tilde{\omega}) = \frac{p_{t}+P_{c,t}\Phi_{c,t}+W_{m,n,t}\Phi_{m,t}+W_{f,n,t}\Phi_{f,t}}{\left[\left(a_{m}\Phi_{m,t}^\rho+a_{f}\Phi_{f,t}^\rho+a_{g}\right)^{\gamma / \rho}(1-a_{Y}) + a_{Y}\Phi_{c,t}^{\gamma}\right]^{1/\gamma}} \]
where one key difference is that the investment ratios: $(\Phi_{m,t},\Phi_{f,t},\Phi_{c,t})$ are calculated using the perceived parameters $\tilde{\omega}$ and not their real values $\omega$.

In the case of no binding borrowing constraints (for example), will result in a final estimating equation:

\[\lambda^{-1}_{S}S_{n,5} = Z_{n,0}\tilde{\phi}_\theta + \sum_{t=0}^4\delta_{2}^{4-t}\delta_{1}\ln\left(\frac{\overline{p}(\Pi_{n,0},Z_{n,0},\tilde{\kappa})\mathcal{X}(\Pi_{n,t},Z_{n,t},\tilde{\kappa},\kappa)\tau^0_{m,n,0}}{\overline{p}(\Pi_{n,t},Z_{n,t}\tilde{\kappa})}\right) + \delta^5_{2}\lambda_{S}^{-1}S_{n,0} + \xi_{S,n} \]
where $\xi_{S,n}$ collects measurement error in $\tau_{m,n,0}$ as well as measurement error in $S_{n,5}$ and $S_{n,0}$. To account for measurement error in both time investment and skills, future observations of time investment ($\tau_{m,n,5}$) are used to instrument for $\tau_{m,n,0}$, and the second measure of skills (applied problems if letter-word is used as the outcome, and vice versa) is used to instrument for the outcome score.

Let $\Delta=(\delta,\phi_{\theta},\omega,\tilde{\omega})$ be the full set of parameters. The final vector of moments, $g_{2,N}(\Delta)$ consists of the pair of residuals $(\xi_{LW,n},\xi_{AP,n})$ each interacted with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The vector of observables allowed to determine $\theta$.
    \item Mother's future time investment, $\log(\tau_{m,n,5})$, and log of full income: $\log(W_{m,n,t}+W_{f,n,t})$ as instruments for mother's time investment.
    \item A full set of interactions between relative prices and the observables that are specified to affect factor shares.
\end{itemize}

Let $g_{N}(\Delta) = [g_{1,N}(\tilde{\omega})^\prime,\ g_{2,n}(\Delta)^\prime]^\prime$ be the full vector of moments. Table \ref{res2} presents estimates that are the solution to
\[ \hat{\Delta} = \arg\min_{\Delta}g_{N}(\Delta)'\hat{\Omega}^{-1}g_{N}(\Delta) \]
where the assumption of unconstrained households is used to impute investment and $\hat{\Omega}$ is the estimated covariance of the moments from a first stage estimate with the identity weighting matrix. Similarly, Table \ref{res3} presents results of the same estimation problem where the assumption that households cannot borrow or save is used to impute investment.

We will find that there is very little information to identify $\omega$ separately from $\tilde{\omega}$ and so both Tables \ref{res2} and \ref{res3} impose the constraint that $\omega=\tilde{\omega}$. Accordingly, we use a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) statistic\footnote{See Newey \& McFadden (1994), Section 9.2} to test equality restrictions on individual components of $\omega$ and $\tilde{\omega}$. As is evident in the tables, in most cases we cannot reject the null of equality. 

For our preferred specification (specification 3) we re-estimate the model having relaxed the particular restrictions that are rejected in the first case. Table \ref{res4} presents the results and shows that even for the case of those parameters that fail the LM test, these parameters cannot be identified separately with sufficient precision. Furthermore, a ``distance metric'' test statistic\footnote{Once again, Newey \& McFadden (1994) Section 9.2}, which follows a $\chi^2$ distribution under the null hypothesis, fails to reject the joint null of equality for these parameters. We conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null of equality $\tilde{\omega}=\omega$.
